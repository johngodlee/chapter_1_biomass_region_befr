On your Chapter 1, which I have estimate is just about ready to send around to co-authors, I spoke to Casey about this in terms of what protocol we should follow. Your paper was not among those we discussed in Mozambique and for which we established core author groups. So, it doesn't have one yet. We should therefore give everyone a chance to be in the core group. Thus... can  you draft a email with a paragraph summary of the paper, and which then invites people to join the core authorship group. Do make it clear in there, in a pilot way, that the analyses are just about done, and that we are not really interested in analytical support per se (i.e. we won't be doing any new substantive analyses... but don't write that!). I think it would also be good to make clear in that email that anybody contributing data to SEOSAW will be welcomed as an author on the paper (even if you didn't end up using all plot data in the analyses). As this is (one of) the first SEOSAW papers, I think it is politically important to be as inclusive as possible. Once you have the email, can you send to Casey and I? We can polish and send to full SEOSAW group. Sound good?


Dear SEOSAW data contributors,
  Since we last met together in Mozambique in 2018 for the SEOSAW network meeting I have been working on the first chapter of my PhD thesis, which uses much of the plot data contributed to the SEOSAW network. The chapter turned out quite well and I would like to publish a reformatted version of the chapter in a peer-reviewed journal. The paper uses a large amount of the data from the SEOSAW plot network and so I am emailing to invite as many as possible of the data contributors to the SEOSAW network to be co-authors on the paper. 

Below is a short summary of the study and its outcomes:

Across many different woodland/forest ecosystems, a positive relationship has been found between tree species diversity and ecosystem functionality measured as standing woody biomass and productivity. In this study I investigated the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass across southern African woodlands. The study is unique in being the first to study this phenomenon within southern African woodlands across such a wide spatial extent. I incorporated environmental data such as water availability and soil fertility to understand how these factors interact with tree species diversity and woodland structure to determine woody biomass. I found a positive tree species diversity - biomass relationship, and that tree species diversity indirectly affects woody biomass by increasing woodland structural diversity. I also found that the effect of tree species diversity on woody biomass increases at higher stem densities, suggesting that tree crown complementarity is a mechanism by which tree species richness increases biomass in these woodlands.

Please respond to this email before the 30th January 2020 if you would like to be included as a co-author on the paper. In the meantime I have attached a copy of the manuscript I intend to submit if you would like to provide comments. The analysis is largely finished, but I would welcome any comments on the general narrative of the paper and particularly your thoughts on vegetation-type specific results as you are more knowledgeable of your own fieldsites than I could ever be. 

Yours,
