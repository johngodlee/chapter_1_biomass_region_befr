On your Chapter 1, which I have estimate is just about ready to send around to co-authors, I spoke to Casey about this in terms of what protocol we should follow. Your paper was not among those we discussed in Mozambique and for which we established core author groups. So, it doesn't have one yet. We should therefore give everyone a chance to be in the core group. Thus... can  you draft a email with a paragraph summary of the paper, and which then invites people to join the core authorship group. Do make it clear in there, in a pilot way, that the analyses are just about done, and that we are not really interested in analytical support per se (i.e. we won't be doing any new substantive analyses... but don't write that!). I think it would also be good to make clear in that email that anybody contributing data to SEOSAW will be welcomed as an author on the paper (even if you didn't end up using all plot data in the analyses). As this is (one of) the first SEOSAW papers, I think it is politically important to be as inclusive as possible. Once you have the email, can you send to Casey and I? We can polish and send to full SEOSAW group. Sound good?


Dear SEOSAW contributors,
  Since we last met together in Mozambique in 2018 I have been working on the first chapter of my PhD thesis, which uses most of the plot data contributed to the SEOSAW network. The chapter turned out quite well and I would like to publish a reformatted version of the chapter in a peer-reviewed journal. I would like to invite as many as possible of the data contributors to the SEOSAW network to be co-authors on the paper.

Below is a summary of the study and its outcomes:

Please respond to this email before _______ if you would like to be included as a co-author on the paper. After that I will send a copy of the manuscript around to
