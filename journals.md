	* Journal of Biogeography supports open research, therefore as a condition for publication, requires that the data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository, such as Dryad, TreeBASE, NERC data centre, GenBank, figshare or another archive of the author’s choice that provides comparable access and guarantee of preservation. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they have shared. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived in a repository Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor.
