I've decided that if I objectively excluded a plot before analysis, before looking at its data, because of it's plot size or number of stems for example, I should not include the data originator for that plot in the author list. If however, I excluded a plot post-hoc, because of some peculiarity with its data, I should include this plot's data originator in the author list.

Data originator names are taken from the `prinv` field in the SEOSAW dataset.

The author list, marked with a [D] for Data originator, or [W] for Writing team. Affiliations follow after:
