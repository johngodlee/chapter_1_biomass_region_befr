Dear SEOSAWs,
    Since I last emailed everybody, I have been working with those who expressed an interest to write a manuscript on the complex relationship between tree species diversity, climate, disturbance and woody biomass across the SEOSAW region. 

I think the paper is pretty much ready to send off to a peer-reviewed journal, most likely Global Ecology & Biogeography, to try and get it published. 

At this point, I'm emailing everybody who contributed with writing and/or data to ask one final time if anybody has any comments or concerns with the paper before I send it off. If you are reading this email I intend to include you as a co-author on the paper because of your contribution to writing and/or the dataset. I understand that for some of you this will be the first time you have read the paper at all, so please do voice any comments you have, but I ask that you do not suggest any major new analyses! We have already done a large number of analyses, including many that do not appear in the paper now, and we feel confident in the results.

If you would like to be included as a co-author please reply with your full name as you would like it to appear on the paper, your affiliation and office address, and your ORCiD ID, if you have one. Additionally, for data originators, I have attached personalised breakdowns of the plot data used in this project for which you are listed as the PI in the SEOSAW dataset. If you feel others deserve co-authorship for their effort in creating the plot data referenced in the attachment, please also reply with their name, affiliation and address, ORCiD ID, and a brief description of their specific contribution.

Outside of the three main authors, Casey, Kyle and myself, I've ordered all other authors alphabetically. I've done this as it proved impossible to fairly rank the contribution of writers alongside those who provided plot data. If you have any serious grievances with this system I'd be happy to try and come to some compromise. 

As I aim to submit this before the university semester begins in earnest, could you please reply if you can by the 15th September 2020.

Many thanks for all your help so far,
John Godlee
