\section{Abstract}

\textbf{Aim:} Positive correlations between tree \rchange{biodiversity}{species diversity} and ecosystem function have been widely documented, but the nature of the relationship \rchange{in highly disturbed and ecophysiologically stressful systems is less clear}{in southern African savanna/woodlands, which experience high levels of disturbance through fire and ecophysiological stress, is less clear}. \rnew{In disturbed systems it is posited that high levels of disturbance may allow the presence of poor competitors, weakening the correlation between biodiversity and niche complementarity which drives ecosystem function.} Here, we explore the relationship between tree species diversity and aboveground biomass across southern African savannas and woodlands, \rchange{with respect to}{while controlling for} gradients in stocking density, resource availability\rnew{, disturbance through fire}, and across vegetation types to build a general understanding of the biodiversity - ecosystem function relationship in this understudied ecological context.

\textbf{Location:} Southern African savannas and woodlands

\textbf{Time period:} 2010-2019

\textbf{Major taxa studied:} Trees

\textbf{Methods:} We used a network of \nplots{} \rchange{savanna and woodland}{savanna/woodland tree} plots located across the southern African sub-continent \rold{in which each tree >10 cm diameter was measured and identified to species level}. We used Structural Equation Modelling with path analysis to determine the relationship between tree species diversity and aboveground woody biomass, while accounting for the interactive effects of resource availability \rnew{, disturbance by fire}, and stocking density.

\textbf{Results:} \rnew{We found} a positive effect of tree species diversity on aboveground biomass \rold{was demonstrated}, observed \rchange{largely as an}{mainly via the} of increasing woodland structural diversity. We also found that the effect of tree species diversity on biomass increases with stocking density. Finally, we found that resource availability affects biomass in southern African woodlands \rchange{largely}{mainly} indirectly, via its effect on species diversity.

\textbf{Main conclusions:} The study underlines the close association between tree diversity, ecosystem structure and \rnew{ecosystem} function of highly disturbed southern African savannas and woodlands. Our results demonstrate the importance of \rchange{including}{accounting for} environmental conditions and vegetation type in order to accurately model a general relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function at a regional level. Biodiversity loss, predominantly \rchange{by}{through} human actions in southern Africa may have detrimental outcomes for ecosystem function, particularly in tree species-poor Baikiaea woodlands, which showed the strongest biodiversity - ecosystem function relationship.

% Studies in natural and experimental settings have shown a positive relationship between tree species diversity and ecosystem functionality but many ecosystems are understudied in this regard. In this study we conducted the first regional estimation of the relationship between tree species diversity and above-ground biomass in southern African woodlands, using a network of \nplots{} woodland plots. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to determine the relationship between tree species diversity and aboveground biomass, with comparison to the effects of resource availability and along a gradient of stocking density. A positive effect of tree species diversity on biomass was demonstrated, with most of this as an indirect effect via woodland structural diversity. We found that the effect of tree species diversity on biomass increases with stocking density. Finally, we found that resource availability determines biomass in southern African woodlands largely indirectly via its effect on species diversity.

\section{Introduction}

In order to understand the effects of global biodiversity change, it is necessary to explore the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function \citep{Tilman2014}. Numerous studies have shown relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function (e.g. \citealt{Liang2016, Hooper2012, Cardinale2009}). The strength and direction of the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function (BEF) relationship varies depending on the ecosystem being studied, the ecosystem function(s) of interest \citep{Hector2007}, and the inclusion of environmental covariates in statistical models \citep{Vila2005}, but there appears to be a generalisable positive correlation between biodiversity and ecosystem function \citep{Liang2016}. Over the past decade, many observational studies of the BEF relationship have been conducted, mostly in wet tropical and temperate forests, and grasslands \citep{Chen2011}. These studies support early findings from small-scale experimental studies \rnew{conducted} predominantly in grassland patches, which began in earnest during the 1990s as concern grew over the global loss of biodiversity \citep{Tilman1994, Tilman2014}. Despite these concerted efforts, we continue to lack a nuanced, ecosystem agnostic understanding of the complex interactions between biodiversity, environment, and ecosystem function.

Ecosystem functions can be defined in broad terms as rate processes and properties of ecosystems which describe the degree of biotic activity within an ecosystem \citep{Jax2005}. This includes \rchange{basic processes of primary production}{processes} such as gross primary productivity and atmospheric nitrogen fixation, but can be extended to indirect measures of function such as resistance of productivity to disturbance, and further to ecosystem properties which themselves influence process, such as trophic complexity and total vegetative biomass. The frequently reported \rold{and intuitive} relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function invokes three main mechanisms \rchange{which drive}{to explain} the relationship \citep{Tilman2014}: 1) niche complementarity, whereby communities with greater biodiversity fill a greater breadth of realised niche space and avoid competition due to differences in their traits; 2) selection effects, whereby communities with greater biodiversity are more likely to include a species that contributes highly to the measured ecosystem function; and 3) facilitation effects, whereby communities with greater biodiversity are more likely to include combinations of species which together increase the others' functional contribution.

Compared to \rchange{other forested}{forest} ecosystems, dry tropical woodlands and savannas are highly structured by disturbance, mainly through fire \rchange{and in Africa notably by herbivory also}{and herbivory, with African savannas possessing large herbivores absent from other savannas} \citep{Sankaran2008, Levick2009}. \rnew{Disturbance via human activities such as timber extraction and charcoal processing is also common in African woodlands, often causing high levels of disturbance in localised areas \citep{}}. High levels of disturbance by fire may weaken the role of competition in determinging local species distribution and allow weak competitors to co-exist where they would normally be excluded \citep{Grime1979, Grace1990}. This means that interspecific competition and therefore the effect of niche complementarity, which contributes the majority of the observed biodiversity effect on ecosystem function in temperate and wet tropical forests \citep{Wright2017, Poorter2015, Sande2017a}, may not be as \rchange{apparent}{important} in dry woodland/savanna ecosystems. Instead, stress tolerance and the functional contribution of more abundant species (selection effects) may be the predominant forces influencing ecosystem function \citep{Lasky2014, Tobner2016}. Similarly, more diverse species assemblages may lead to facilitation effects between certain species combinations \rchange{in environments which are more hostile to growth}{under limiting environmental conditions such as low water availability \citep{} or high maximum temperature \citep{}}. Across European forests \citet{Ratcliffe2017} found stronger positive relationships between tree species richness and various ecosystem functions in more arid environments. They suggest that in water-limited ecosystems, facilitative effects and selection effects may be more important than niche complementarity in driving the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function, \rnew{as competition diminishes in ecosystems where environmental stress limits individual species reaching the bounds of their fundamental niche space, thus reducing the competition which drives niche complementarity effects.} This potential mismatch in the contribution of different mechanisms to the BEF relationship between dry tropical woodlands and other forested ecosystems demands further investigation \rchange{in order to characterise}{if we are to derive} a generalisable BEF relationship.

The representation of dry tropical ecosystems in the BEF relationship literature is poor compared to other ecosystems. \citet{Clarke2017} conducted a meta-analysis of 182 published BEF relationship studies, finding that only 13\% were conducted in the tropics generally, with 42\% of those being conducted in the wet tropical forests of Costa Rica, which hold many endemic species and unique ecosystem assemblages \citep{Barthlott2005}. A severe lack of study in dry tropical ecosystems, especially given the potential mismatch in BEF relationship mechanisms described above, suggests that a focus on these ecosystems could greatly strengthen our understanding of a general BEF relationship and its environmental determinants. Savannas and woodlands are the dominant vegetation type across the southern African region, spanning >4 million km\textsuperscript{2} \citep{White1987, Ratnam2011, Ryan2016} (\autoref{clust_map}). The carbon stored in this vegetation is comparable to that found in the wet forests of the Congo basin, and is of global importance to the carbon cycle \citep{Houghton2009, Mayaux2008}. Climatic conditions and biogeography vary across southern African vegetation, resulting in a diverse range of savanna and woodland tree species assemblages\rchange{, which}{.These} retain the common features of an open tree canopy and an understorey generally dominated by C4 \rchange{grass species}{grasses}. Southern African savannas and woodlands are highly diverse, thought to harbour \textapprox{}8500 plant species of which \rold{there are} >300 \rnew{are} \rchange{tree species}{trees} \citep{Frost1996}, and have been identified by previous studies as a priority for conservation efforts \citep{Byers2001, Mittermeier2003}. Many conservation projects in the region currently aim to conserve biodiversity and woody biomass stocks simultaneously under the directive of the United Nations REDD+ programme or the similar Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) \citep{Hinsley2015}. Despite these efforts however, human actions are driving rapid changes in biodiversity, with largely unquantified consequences for ecosystem structure and function.

A small number of studies in southern African woodlands, \rnew{all of which were restricted in the spatial scope to a small region of miombo woodland}, have found that above-ground woody carbon/biomass stocks correlate positively with tree species richness \citep{McNicol2018, Shirima2015, Mutowo2012}. The results of these fine scale studies concur with similar studies in other biomes \citep{}. Studies of the BEF relationship often find that at fine scales, biodiversity shows a strong effect on ecosystem function, but at broad scales biodiversity effects pale in significance compared to abiotic factors such as climate \citep{Pasari2013}. Due to the highly variable environmental conditions within which southern African woodlands occur \citep{Frost1996}, \rnew{with wide variation in precipitation, diurnal and annual temperature range} and given the potential importance of environment and biogeography in defining the strength and form of a relationship between biodiversity and above ground woody biomass \citep{}, it is important to sample across geographic and environmental gradients to gain understanding of the spatial variation in the relationship between biodiversity and biomass. 

%Environmental conditions may also indirectly moderate the observed relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function \citep{Vila2005}.

% Kunz et al. (2019) found that crown complementarity and crown plasticity increased with species richness. Trees growing in species rich neighbourhoods had enhanced AGB production in trunk and branches.

%While southern African woodlands are species rich in the herbaceous understorey \citep{Murphy2016}, the tree layer is relatively species poor. 

In forests, climatic variation is known to affect both woody biomass \citep{Michaletz2014, Michaletz2018} and tree species diversity independently \citep{Spasojevic2014}. It is important therefore to account for climatic factors and understand how they interact with biomass and biodiversity to effectively model and correctly attribute the effects of biodiversity on woody biomass in analyses at broad spatial scales. \citet{Sankaran2005} used data from 854 African woodland field sites to show that \rnew{below a threshold of \textapprox{}650 mm MAP}, precipitation sets sets the upper limit for woody cover in savannas, which is positively correlated with biomass \citep{Chisholm2013, Prado-Junior2016}. Similarly, \citet{Condit2013} found that dry season intensity was the main determinant of tree species distribution and abundance evenness in a wet Panamanian tropical forest.

\citet{Solbrig1996} writes that southern African woodlands possess structurally diverse tree canopies, with trees occupying distinct layers of the canopy at different growth stages and among species. This structural diversity may be one mechanism through which tree species diversity influences woody biomass. \citet{Kunz2019} found that crown complementarity and crown plasticity both increased with species richness in a seasonally dry subtropical forest. They also found that trees growing in species-rich neighbourhoods exhibited enhanced biomass production. \rchange{Occupation}{Occupancy} of multiple canopy layers allows a \rchange{more full}{fuller} canopy with \rold{a} greater total foliage density, enhancing productivity and allowing greater standing woody biomass in a smaller area via a form of niche complementarity. This mechanism however, which has been supported by experiments and observational studies in temperate and wet tropical ecosystems \citep{Hardiman2011, Stark2012}, may not be relevant in savannas. Instead, the overriding importance of disturbance history may negate the effects of tree species diversity on structural diversity \citep{Grime2012}.

High levels of disturbance in southern African woodlands may moderate the observable BEF relationship through its effect on ecosystem composition. Fire disturbance in forests has been linked to abundance-dependent mortality among smaller trees \citep{Roques2001, Staver2009, Bond2005}. Some species in the regional species pool may be excluded from woodland plots with high levels of disturbance if they are unable to escape the fire bottleneck and grow to become a large tree. Selection effects may therefore be more important in maximising ecosystem function in disturbance prone woodlands. If the regional species pool contains a large number of species, it is more likely that one of them will possess the necessary growth strategy to grow to a large tree with high biomass under an intense disturbance regime. 

In this study, we made the first known regional estimation of the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship across southern African savannas and woodlands, using inventory plots which span environmental and biogeographical gradients (\autoref{clust_map}). We used aboveground woody biomass of trees \rnew{as our metric of ecosystem function}, and compared the relative effects of tree species diversity with that of environmental factors known to affect ecosystem productivity and biomass accumulation, namely water availability, energy input and soil fertility. We also investigated the potential moderating effects of environmental covariates on the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass. We incorporated vegetation type (via clustering of plot-level tree species composition), as a factor in our analyses to understand how tree species composition as well as diversity affected ecosystem function and to assess the generality of our results. We used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) \rchange{and}{with} path analysis as a preferred method to simultaneously account for environmental and biotic factors, \rchange{which may interact their effect}{which may have interacting effects} on ecosystem structure and therefore biomass. Initially, we \rchange{made}{posited} three hypotheses: (1) water availability and soil fertility will indirectly positively affect woody biomass via an increase in tree species diversity, (2) \rchange{the effect size}{the strength of the effect} of tree species diversity on woody biomass will increase with plot level stocking density, due to an increased importance of niche complementarity as competition increases, and (3) tree species diversity will increase tree structural diversity \rnew{(i.e. physiognomic diversity)}, which will provide an indirect path by which tree diversity increases woody biomass.

\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Study location}

The study used \nplots{} woodland monitoring plots from the larger SEOSAW network \citep{seosaw_web} located across 10 countries within southern Africa in the \rchange{so-called miombo woodland eco-region}{miombo ecoregion} (\autoref{clust_map}, \citealt{White1987}). The study \rchange{region spans}{area spans the core climate space of the region}, with a precipitation gradient from \textapprox{}460 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in southern Mozambique and southern Zimbabwe to \textapprox{}1700 mm y\textsuperscript{-1} in northern Zambia, Malawi and northern Mozambique. The 2D convex hull of Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) of the study sites covers \hullcover{}\% of the pixel-wise climate space of the miombo woodland ecoregion \rold{as defined by} \citep{White1987}, using WorldClim estimates of temperature and precipitation between the year 1970 and 2000 with a pixel size of 30 arc seconds (0.86 km\textsuperscript{2} at the equator) \citep{Fick2017}. 

Plots were chosen from a larger pool of 5395 plots based on the quality and completeness of data collection, and plot setup. Plot vegetation was identified under the broad term of ``savanna'', which includes ``woodland'', ``savanna woodland'', and ``tree savanna'', variously defined in other areas of the scientific literature and here referred to collectively as southern African woodlands \citep{Ratnam2011, Hill2010}. Plots with evidence of farming, human resource extraction or experimental treatments such as prescribed burning or herbivore exclusion were excluded from the initial pool. Only plots >0.1 hectares were used in analysis, as area-based biomass estimation from small plots is highly influenced by rare large trees \citep{Stegen2011}, leading to inaccurate estimates. Only plots with a stocking density >50 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} (>10 cm stem diameter) were used, to ensure all plots were within woodland rather than ``grassy savanna'', which are considered a separate biome with very different species composition \citep{Parr2014}. 

Many plots provided by the 2005-2008 Zambian Integrated Land Use Assessment \citep{Mukosha2009} were arranged in clusters of up to four 20x50 m plots, 20 metres apart. Plots within each cluster were aggregated before the plot dataset filtering described above and treated as a single plot in analyses.

\rold{After the initial plot data cleaning described above, we conducted an outlier removal procedure of plots with rare tree species composition. We used the outlier() function from the dave R package citep{dave}, which uses a nearest neighbour criterion for each plot in species abundance ordination space and a threshold value for the minimum nearest neighbour distance to identify outliers. We set the threshold value to remove the top 5\% of plots with the largest nearest neighbour distances in multidimensional species composition space citep{Otto2013}, thus removing noutliers{} plots (hyperref[appendixa]{Appendix A}).}

\subsection{Data collection}
 
We considered only trees and shrubs in our calculations of Above-Ground woody Biomass (AGB), including woody species such as palms and cycads which are functionally tree-like, but excluding lianas, which fill a different ecological niche \citep{Selaya2008}. Only stems >10 cm DBH (Diameter at Breast Height, 1.3 m) were included in analyses. Many plots in the dataset did not include data on stems <10 cm DBH. For those plots which contained stem measurements <10 cm DBH, small stems only accounted for a median of \percsmallagb{}\% of the plot level AGB. 

All stems >10 cm DBH were measured within each plot resulting in a total of \num[group-separator={,}]{\ntrees{}} stems with measurements. A tree may be comprised of multiple stems and so tree-level diversity estimates were used to prevent bias towards species which readily coppice. For each tree, we \rchange{measured}{recorded} species, DBH and tree height to the top of the highest branch material. Height was measured through a variety of means including laser rangefinders, manual clinometers and measuring sticks. When DBH could not be measured at 1.3 m due to trunk abnormalities, it was measured at the closest regular portion of the trunk to 1.3 m. The height of this measurement was recorded and used to estimate the DBH\textsubscript{e} at 1.3 m using a cubic polynomial regression, with parameters estimated using a test dataset from Ryan C., (unpublished), see \citet{Godlee2020}.

AGB for each plot was calculated using \autoref{chave_agb}, taken from \citet{Chave2014}:

\begin{equation}
	AGB = 0.0673 \times (\rho D^{2} H)^{0.976}
	\label{chave_agb}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the species level mean wood density, $D$ is the DBH\textsubscript{e} at 1.3 m, and $H$ is the tree height. Wood density estimates were taken from the global wood density database for each species where possible \citep{Chave2009, Zanne2009}. Wood density for species without species level estimates was estimated from the means of their respective \rchange{genus}{genera}. For stems where tree height was unknown, the plot location was used to estimate tree height, according to \citet{Chave2014}.

Climatic data were collected from the ECMWF ERA5 dataset, generated using Copernicus Climate Change Service Information \citep{ERA5}. Values of \rchange{Mean Annual Temperature (MAT)}{MAT} and \rchange{Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP)}{MAP} was calculated from daily data between 2000 and 2018, then averaged across years to provide a single mean annual estimate per plot. Temperature seasonality (TS) and precipitation seasonality (PS) were both calculated as the mean of the coefficient of variation of daily mean temperature and precipitation, respectively, for each of the 18 years of available data. Soil fertility data was extracted from the ISRIC gridded soil information data product at 250 m resolution, taking the grid cell value for each plot centre \citep{Hengl2017}. We extracted Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), percentage soil organic carbon by volume (Org. C \%), and percentage soil sand content by volume (Sand \%). These data are a modelled product derived from various remotely sensed and directly measured data sources. 

% \todo{Fire return interval ($F_{ret}$) was calculated using the MODIS burned area product V6 (MCD46A1) \citep{}. Data was downloaded from January 2000 to December 2018. Mean fire return interval was calculated as:}

% \end{equation}
%

\subsection{Data analysis}

\subsubsection{Species diversity and structural diversity metrics}

Estimated tree species richness was calculated for each plot using \verb|ChaoRichness()| from the \verb|iNEXT| package in R \citep{Hsieh2016}. This procedure extrapolates a species rarefaction curve to its predicted asymptote and uses this value as its estimated species richness value. Extrapolated species richness accounts for variation in plot size (0.1-10 ha) and therefore sampling effort among plots. Larger plots will tend to encompass more individuals, and therefore more species \citep{Dengler2009}. To measure tree species \rold{abundance} evenness, the Shannon Equitability index ($E_{H'}$) \citep{Smith1996} was calculated as the ratio of the estimated Shannon diversity index to the natural log of estimated species richness. Abundance evenness allows for greater niche complementarity at small scales due to an increased spatial heterogeneity of functional traits. We calculated tree structural diversity for each plot by calculating the coefficient of variation of DBH (DBH CV) and tree height (Height CV). 

% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{gathered}
% 		E_{H'} = \frac{H'_{e}}{\ln{S}} \\
% 	\end{gathered}
% 	\label{shannon_equit}
% \end{equation}
% 
% Where $H'_{e}$ is an estimation of the Shannon diversity index of trees by extrapolation of the observed Shannon diversity index ($H'$) to its asymptote via Hill numbers using the \verb|ChaoShannon()| function from the \verb|iNEXT| package in R \citep{Hsieh2016}, and $S$ is the extrapolated tree species richness in the plot, using the \verb|ChaoRichness()| function. 

\subsubsection{Vegetation clusters}

Plots were assigned to vegetation type groups based on tree species composition. Groups were defined in \citet{Fayolle2018} in an Africa-wide analysis of floristic units using plot data in savannas and woodlands with tree species diversity and relative abundance data. Group identification was conducted using unconstrained correspondence analysis\rold{ and ordination}, followed by clustering based on dominant ordination axes. Plot data used in this study occurred in four vegetation type groups. See \autoref{clust_summ} for a description of each vegetation cluster and \autoref{clust_map} for the spatial distribution of plots from each of these clusters .

	\label{clust_map}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

\subsubsection{Structural Equation Modelling}

\rnew{We used} Structural Equation Models (SEM) to investigate the determinants of AGB. All SEMs were constructed and analysed in the \verb|lavaan| package \citep{lavaan} in R version 3.6.0 \citep{R2019}. SEM was used because of its suitability for modelling complex causal interactions in ecological systems \citep{Lee2007}. A key aspect to our decision to use SEMs is that they can explicitly model and partition variance \rnew{attributed} to indirect effects, which is challenging in standard multiple regressions. Using SEMs also allowed us to describe latent variables such as ``resource availability'', ``soil fertility'', and ``disturbance'' which have been suggested to act upon biodiversity and biomass/productivity in previous studies despite these factors not having observable measures in our dataset. SEM is also necessary to properly account for potential feedback mechanisms between aspects of \rchange{climate}{environment} and tree species diversity, which could otherwise increase the chances of Type I error and wrongly attribute inference due to the covariance of explanatory variables when using conventional regression analyses \citep{Nachtigall2003}.

Prior to analysis, we specified a conceptual model with factors expected to affect AGB: moisture availability, soil fertility, disturbance through fire, tree species diversity, tree structural diversity and stocking density (\autoref{con_mod}). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{concept}
	\caption{Conceptual Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) showing the theoretical relationships between environmental factors, tree species diversity, tree structural diversity, stocking density, and AGB. Hypothesised paths of causation are depicted as arrows from predictor to response.}
	\label{con_mod}
\end{figure}

Observed variables were transformed to achieve normality where necessary and standardised to Z-scores prior to analysis (\hyperref[appendixa]{Appendix A}). Standardisation put each latent variable on the same scale, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Standardisation allows path regression coefficients to be easily compared between paths in the same model to assess their relative effect size, and eliminates confusion in model interpretation arising from the observed variables being on different scales \citep{Beaujean2014}. Standardisation also controls for variables with different orders of magnitude, which could otherwise prevent adequate model estimation from the covariance matrix in \verb|lavaan|. To ensure that observed variables within a latent variable had consistent directions of influence, some observed variables had their sign reversed. For example, overall moisture availability is expected to decrease as soil sand content increases, therefore sand content was reversed for use in the moisture availability latent variable. Precipitation seasonality, and temperature stress were also reversed in this way to account for the direction of their effect on moisture availability. 

%While it is recommended by some to set exact factor loadings in the SEM from the regression coefficients of multiple regressions \citep{lavaan}, because some latent variables were regressed against both structural diversity and AGB, exact factor loadings from simple multiple regressions could not be used. We therefore allowed factor loadings to be estimated by the SEM itself.

The factor loadings of the observed variable assumed to contribute most to each latent variable were set to one, as per convention, with other observed variables being allowed to vary \citep{Beaujean2014}.  We tested the robustness of our assumptions with a chi-squared test of all possible combinations of observed variable factor loadings set to one, while ensuring no factor loadings were in excess of one. We found no significant difference between model specifications (p>0.05). Full Information Max-Likelihood (FIML) was used in each model to estimate the values of missing data in each latent variable \citep{Cham2017}.

We assessed the role of tree species diversity and tree structural diversity in determining AGB via a simple mediation model which allowed species diversity to influence AGB both directly and indirectly via structural diversity. To account for variation in stocking density, which may covary with species diversity, we also included it as an observed variable in our model. To explore variation in the model among woodland vegetation types, we fit the model both at the regional scale and for each vegetation cluster separately. We compared unstandardised path coefficients among these vegetation cluster scale models to understand the effect that vegetation type has on the relationship between tree species diversity, structural diversity, stocking density and AGB. Path coefficients show the effect of a path with other paths of inference held constant. Models were estimated using the ``MLM'' estimator, because it is robust to multivariate non-normality \citep{Shapiro1983}. Model fit was evaluated using the robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the robust Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), the Root Mean Squared Error \rnew{of Approximation} (RMSEA) and the R\textsuperscript{2} coefficient of determination for AGB. We critically assess model fit in each case, taking into consideration the recommendations of \citet{Hu1999} \rchange{which}{who} define threshold values of acceptability for these model fit indices: CFI >0.85, TLI >0.85, RMSEA <0.15, alongside our judgement of the model estimates.

To explore the hypothesis that niche complementarity effects increase in strength as stocking density increases, we repeatedly sub-sampled the available plot dataset to create \subn{} datasets of similar size with varying median stocking density. We used each of these datasets separately to fit the model including only tree species and structural diversity latent variables to predict AGB. We excluded the effect of stocking density on AGB and the correlation between stocking density and species diversity from this model as we deliberately controlled stocking density in our subsampling. We then examined how the unstandardised path coefficients for each path in the SEM varied according to the median stocking density of subsampled datasets.

We incorporated environmental covariates into our model to understand the relative effects of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire on AGB both directly and indirectly via species diversity and stocking density. We compared standardised path coefficients between paths in the model to understand the relative contribution of each path to explain variance in AGB. Vegetation type specific models could not be reliably fitted for this more complex model specification with environmental covariates, due to sample size issues and because some vegetation types were narrow in their climate space, leading to a lack of variance particularly in the moisture availability latent variable.

% We fitted separate moderation models to investigate whether there was an interaction effect whereby the strength of the relationship between species diversity and AGB was influenced by moisture availability and soil fertility. The \verb|lavaan| R package does not natively support moderation of latent variables in its model specification. Instead we manually calculated interaction variables for both soil fertility and moisture availability from the product of predicted values of these latent variables in a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Interaction variables were the products: tree species diversity $\times$ moisture availability, and tree species diversity $\times$ soil fertility. These interaction terms were included as explanatory terms in multiple regressions alongside the latent variable of species diversity to predict AGB. Regression coefficients and model fit were analysed to determine the presence and form of interaction effects.

	\label{corr_mat}
\end{figure}

Pairwise correlations between all observed variables used in the Structural Equation Models (SEMs) showed that all tree species diversity and structural diversity variables had moderate positive correlations with AGB. stocking density had the strongest correlation with AGB of all variables \rnew{considered} (\ccib{}). Environmental variables had weaker correlations with AGB than diversity variables, with all environmental variables having significant correlations with AGB, except fire frequency.

The direction of these correlations was used as a test of our assumptions for the direction of influence of latent variables later used in the SEMs. As expected, there was a positive correlation between MAP and AGB (\ccmb{}), and a weak negative correlation between the seasonality of precipitation and AGB (\ccmcb{}). Temperature stress was \rnew{weakly} negatively correlated \rold{weakly} with AGB (\cctcb{}). As expected, there was a negative correlation between soil sand content and AGB (\ccsb{}), and a positive correlation between soil nutrient content and AGB (carbon: \ccob{}, nitrogen: \ccnb{}). 

MAP had positive correlations with all tree species diversity and structural diversity variables. Tree species diversity variables had clear positive correlations with stocking density (species richness: \ccsi{}; Shannon equitability: \ccei{}), but structural diversity variables showed weak correlations with stocking density (DBH CoV: \ccdvi{}, Height CoV: \cchvi{}).

\subsection{Structural and species diversity models}

In an SEM describing the effect of tree species diversity on AGB via the mediating effects of tree structural diversity and stocking density (\autoref{struc_mod}), species diversity showed no direct effect on AGB (\strucbetadb{}), but did have an indirect positive effect via structural diversity (\strucbetadib{}) (\autoref{struc_mod}). Model fit was good with high factor loadings for all observed variables. All other path coefficients were significant (p <0.01) (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}). The R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB was \strucrsq{}. The strongest direct effect on AGB was from stocking density (\strucbetaib{}).

\subsection{Variation among vegetation types}

When the tree species and structural diversity model (\autoref{struc_mod}) was refitted separately using data from each of the four vegetation types, model fit and the strengths of unstandardised path coefficients varied. The direct effect of tree species diversity on AGB was positive and marginally significant in Acacia (\strucbetacsb{}) but negligible in Mopane (\strucbetadsb{}), Marginal miombo (\strucbetaasb{}) and Core miombo (\strucbetabsb{}) (\autoref{struc_model_slopes_all}). Relationships between structural diversity and AGB remained generally similar, with the same sign and overlap between the 95\% confidence intervals of path coefficients. The R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB was highest in Acacia shrubland (R\textsuperscript{2} = \struccrsq{}) and lowest in Marginal miombo (R\textsuperscript{2} = \strucarsq{}). The total effect of species diversity on AGB remained strongly positive for all vegetation types. All vegetation types exhibited a positive effect of species diversity on structural diversity. All models had adequate goodness-of-fit (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}), though confidence intervals around the unstandardised path coefficients were wide particularly for Mopane and Acacia. $\chi^{2}$ statistics were high for some vegetation types, but this appears to be highly correlated with sample size for each vegetation type \citep{Hooper2008}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Moderation of Diversity-AGB relationship by stocking density}

In our sub-sampling of the plot dataset by stocking density, we found an increasing positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB as stocking density increased (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}). There appears to be a minimum stocking density threshold at \textapprox{}180 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1} below which there appears to be a reasonably constant baseline effect of tree diversity on biomass. The effect of structural diversity on AGB appears to remain constant with increasing stocking density. The indirect effect of species diversity on AGB via structural diversity climbs slightly as stocking density increases.

	\label{sem_struc_stems_ha}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Environmental covariates and tree diversity}

A model incorporating the latent variables of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire showed that the total effect of tree species diversity on biomass was similar to that of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance (\autoref{full_mod}, \autoref{full_model_slopes}). Surprisingly, the direct effects of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance on AGB were negligible (moisture, \fmbetamb{}, soil: \fmbetasb{}, disturbance: \fmbetafb{}), with nearly all of their observed effect on AGB coming from the indirect path via stocking density (moisture: \fmbetamib{}, soil: \fmbetasib{}, disturbance: \fmbetafib{}) and species diversity (moisture: \fmbetamd{}, soil: \fmbetasd{}, disturbance: \fmbetafd{}). MAP and soil sand content had the greatest contributions to the latent variable of moisture availability. Model fit was acceptable: CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.900, and RMSEA = \fmrmsea{}, R\textsuperscript{2} of AGB = \fmrsq{}.

Similar to the model that only considered tree species and structural diversity (\autoref{struc_mod}), the direct effect of species diversity on structural diversity was positive, while structural diversity itself had a positive effect on AGB, leading to a strong positive indirect effect of species diversity on AGB via structural diversity (\fmbetadhb{}) when environmental covariates were accounted for. Again, the direct effect of species diversity on AGB was negligible (\fmbetadb{}) The total effect of species diversity on AGB was positive (\fmbetatotaldb{}).

% \subsection{Moderation effects of moisture availability and soil}
% 
% To address the hypothesis (H\textsubscript{1}) that more arid plots and plots with less fertile soil will show a stronger positive effect of tree species richness on above ground woody biomass, we fit separate linear multiple regressions with the latent variables of moisture availability and soil fertility as moderators on the relationship between species diversity and AGB.
% 
% Both soil fertility and moisture availability had small positive interaction effects on the strength of the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass (\autoref{int_plots}). The regression coefficient for the interaction effect of tree species diversity and moisture availability was significant (\moderp{}), while the interaction term of tree species diversity and soil fertility was marginally significant (\moders{}). As moisture availability increased, the effect of tree species diversity on AGB became stronger. See \autoref{mois_div_int_mod} and \autoref{soil_div_int_mod} for full regression tables.

\section{Discussion}

% Precipitation and soil fertility will indirectly positively effect AGB via an increase in tree species diversity.
% Tree structural diversity will indirectly influence tree species diversity to provide an indirect path of influence between structural diversity and AGB.
% The effect size of species diversity on AGB will increase with stocking density, due to an increased importance of niche complementarity as competition increases.

In this study, we assessed the importance of [a] tree species diversity, [b] tree structural diversity, [c] resource availability, [d] disturbance by fire, [e] stocking density and their interactions on above ground woody biomass (AGB) across southern African woodlands, using a network of \nplots{} woodland plots. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), we found support for a general positive relationship between tree species diversity and AGB indirectly via structural diversity (H\textsubscript{1}). We found that the effect size of tree species diversity on AGB increased with stocking density (H\textsubscript{2}).  Tree species diversity, structural diversity and stocking density accounted for \smrsq{}\% of the variation in AGB across the region, while models for specific vegetation types showed even greater explanatory power in some cases (\autoref{struc_model_fit_clust_stats}). The strongest effect on AGB was that of stocking density. When the effects of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire were controlled for, the total explanatory power of tree species diversity and structural diversity decreased, but the predictive power of the model increased, suggesting that it is important to control for environmental covariates to understand the true effect of tree species diversity on AGB in regional scale assessments in southern African woodlands.

\subsection{Inter-related effects of tree species and structural diversity on AGB}

We found a consistent positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB across all models in the current study. Within southern African woodlands we therefore find support for our hypothesis that higher tree species richness and evenness causes higher woody AGB. This finding is in agreement with many other studies across different ecosystems and biomes, supporting \rnew{the idea} that there is a generalisable positive association between biodiversity and ecosystem function \citep{Liang2016, Cardinale2009}. Our study provides a novel dissection of the mechanisms underlying this relationship, particularly in the context of southern African woodlands, a disturbance-structured and poorly studied ecological system.

% In our extrapolation of species richness according to sampling effort (stocking density) we partially accounted for this effect, but our analyses cannot properly assess to what extent a real effect of species diversity on stocking density exists. We cannot decompose the relative effects of tree species richness and abundance evenness in our model, but previous studies have shown that both richness and evenness have similar importance in their effects on ecosystem function \citep{Valery2009, Zhang2012}.

Much of the total variation in AGB was driven by variation in stocking density. It is possible that within southern African woodlands a higher species diversity allows for a higher stocking density through niche separation, which reduces competition between species occupying varying niche space, leading to an increase in total AGB per unit area. The opposite causation is also plausible however, with increased stocking density causing higher species richness through an increased probability of encountering new species. We attempted to correct for the correlation between species richness and stocking density by estimating the extrapolated species richness. We suggest therefore that an increase in tree species diversity through species richness and evenness produces an assemblage of species which can utilise more available light and moisture, resulting in greater plot-level AGB. This is supported by the moderately strong indirect positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB via structural diversity, and the positive effect of moisture availability on AGB via stocking density in the model which included environmental covariates. However, we found a negative effect of soil fertility on AGB via stocking density. 

We found evidence that tree species diversity led to an increase in AGB indirectly via tree structural diversity, and we therefore find support for our second hypothesis (H\textsubscript{2}). A higher tree species diversity allows for a greater structural diversity of trees, i.e. greater variation in DBH and height. This may act as a mechanism for niche complementarity, with a highly diverse canopy able to take advantage of a greater proportion of the available light. Although we did not measure them here, we would also expect that tree species diversity allows for a greater range of tree functional forms \citep{}, i.e. wider variation in canopy shape and overall growth form; bushy understorey vs. emergent canopy, for example. In forests, where the tree canopy is effectively closed, as the stand matures a more diverse canopy emerges via competition and tree mortality events which open canopy gaps \citep{Muscolo2014}. Indeed, our finding that the strength of the effect of tree diversity on AGB increases with stocking density supports this. In frequently disturbed woodlands such as those studied here however, a woodland canopy similar to that of a forest is frequently not reached. Instead, a simple open canopy is maintained that can be made more complex and productive via an increase in species diversity. Previous studies have found that southern African woodlands with higher species diversity tend to \rnew{experience less frequent disturbance by fire and tend to form a more closed canopy and a more sparse understorey} \citep{Chidumayo2013, Mutowo2012}. In our study however, we found a positive effect of disturbance on species diversity, perhaps suggesting that disturbance prevents domination of woodlands by a single dominant species \citep{Chidumayo2013}.

We found a non linear positive effect of stocking density on the relationship between tree species diversity and AGB (\autoref{sem_struc_stems_ha}). At low stocking densities competition between \rnew{mature} trees may not occur, meaning that the niche complementarity effect provided by an increase in tree species richness may not be present, accounting for the low and constant effect of tree species diversity on AGB below \textapprox{}180 trees ha\textsuperscript{-1}. At very high stem density, there is also increase in the effect of species diversity on structural diversity. This could be because at high stem density, the adaptation of different species to growth form become important. At low stem density, individual trees tend to spread out rather than growing tall, but at high stem density, only certain species ara able to exist in the understory, while others are able to grow tall above the woodland canopy, leading to greater variation in tree height over the plot.

\subsection{Effects of moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance}

Moisture availability, soil fertility and disturbance by fire had similar positive total effects on AGB, comparable in size to the total effect of tree species diversity on AGB. We expected that higher moisture availability and soil fertility would lead to higher AGB under the assumption that higher resource availability would allow for a greater stocking density per unit area, greater productivity per unit area and additionally greater tree species diversity due to niche partitioning \citep{Kraaij2006, Shirima2015}. Previous studies in tropical forests have shown that moisture availability increases AGB both directly and indirectly via increasing tree species diversity and via increasing stand structural diversity \citep{Ali2019a, Ali2019b, Poorter2017}. In this study, we observed weak indirect positive effects on AGB via species diversity and a positive direct effect on AGB. Compared to moist tropical forests, moisture availability is more of a limiting factor to tree growth in southern African woodlands, which \rchange{are frequently droughted}{experience frequent drought}. It is surprising that disturbance by fire had a positive total effect on AGB. We found a positive indirect effect of disturbance on AGB via species diversity and structural diversity. It is possible that fire prevents the domination of a woodland by a few highly competitive species, resulting in greater abundance evenness and overall species richness, which in turn increases the effect of niche complementarity. In southern African woodlands moisture availability is linked to the intensity of disturbance from seasonal fires. The growth of C4 grasses in wetter woodlands leads to more intense seasonal fires which limit tree growth \citep{Charles-Dominique2018}, and may also limit species diversity \citep{Linder2014}. It is possible therefore that the effect of moisture availability, which is expected to increase AGB, is confounded in its effect on AGB with fire frequency, which had a negative effect on stocking density, which is expected to decrease AGB. The direct effect of moisture availability on stocking density may also be confounded in this way. This may also have caused us to not observe a stronger effect between moisture availability and AGB. We found a positive total effect of soil fertility on AGB in our model. We measured soil fertility using the observed variables of soil carbon, nitrogen and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). In wet tropical forests a clear relationship has been observed between these variables and AGB \citep{Slik2009, Coelho-de-Souza2019}. 

\subsection{Vegetation type responses}

All four vegetation types produced similar results in the simple SEM, with a positive total effect of species diversity on AGB, the majority being indirectly via structural diversity. This demonstrates the robustness of our results, showing they are generalisable across vegetation types in southern Africa. It also demonstrates that similar ecosystem processes are occurring in these vegetation types, despite variation in species composition and overall species richness.

Core miombo and marginal miombo woodland vegetation exhibited a small negative direct effect of tree species diversity on AGB, while the total effect, incorporating the indirect effect via structural diversity, remained positive in these vegetation types. Compared to Acacia and Mopane woodlands, miombo woodlands have higher median tree species richness. Acacia and Mopane woodlands are dominated by fewer tree species, notably \textit{Senegalia} spp. in Acacia woodlands and \textit{Colophospermum mopane} in Mopane woodlands which often produce large canopy dominating trees. We postulate that the negative effect of tree species richness on AGB in miombo woodlands may be due to an increase in interspecific competition through canopy crowding, but that this effect is not present in Acacia and Mopane woodlands, where the woodland canopy is dominated often by a single species. Higher functional redundancy among tree species in miombo woodlands may lead to smaller trees with lower AGB in the most diverse plots, more resembling thicket vegetation, while in the species poor Mopane and Acacia woodlands, the addition of extra species may fill a greater proportional niche space, thus increasing total AGB more. 

Despite Mopane woodland having very low species diversity generally, with often monospecific stands \citep{Timberlake2010}, a positive effect of tree species diversity on AGB was observed. In previous studies across ecosystem types it has been found often that the effect on ecosystem function of adding species is stronger in low diversity assemblages \citep{Hector2007}. This has been attributed to an increase in functional redundancy as species diversity increases. \textit{I.e.} with more species, it is more likely that the addition of a new species will occupy the same ecological niche space as an existing species, meaning niche complementarity will not occur and competition will lead to niche partitioning, while making little difference to overall ecosystem functioning. Mopane woodlands also have a negligible effect of species diversity on structural diversity. This may be due to the species which tend to co-exist with \textit{C. mopane}, many of which are small shrub-like trees which do not grow into large canopy trees \citep{Timberlake2010}. Larger canopy trees tend to have greater variation in physical structure \citep{Seidel2019}.

Acacia woodland had the strongest total effect of species diversity on AGB and was the only vegetation type to show a clearly positive direct effect of species diversity on AGB. Acacia also has relatively low median species richness compared to miombo, but the addition of new species appears to make a larger difference to the AGB of these plots than in mopane woodlands. We suggest that this is due mostly to the particular identity of species found in Acacia woodlands and their contribution to ecosystem functioning. Unlike mopane woodlands, Acacia woodlands do sometimes contain species other than \textit{Senegalia} spp. which can grow to be high biomass canopy trees, especially in transition zones. 

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this study we found that across southern African woodlands, there is a generalisable positive association between tree species diversity and woody biomass as a measure of ecosystem function. Additionally, we found that much of this effect of species diversity on biomass exists as an indirect effect by increasing the structural diversity of woodland trees. We found that the multiple vegetation types which comprise southern African woodlands exhibit similarities in the relationship between species diversity and woody biomass, inferring that similar ecosystem processes occur across the region to determine ecosystem function. In contrast to previous studies, we found that across the region, the direct effects of moisture availability and soil fertility on woody biomass were negligible, with most of their effect being indirectly through tree species and structural diversity. 

Southern African woodlands are relied heavily upon for their ecosystem service provision, which is itself affected by ecosystem function. Resource extraction by humans in southern Africa is directly influencing biodiversity via selective tree-felling for timber, among other forest products. Our study shows that biodiversity change through human actions will have the greatest negative impact on ecosystem function in areas of high stocking density, and low species diversity, which are predominantly targeted for tree felling. This raises concerns about the robustness of these ecosystems to further resource extraction and biodiversity loss.
