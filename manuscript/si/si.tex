A single linear regression is presented as a black line, which combines all vegetation types, separate loess trend lines are fitted for each vegetation type. An orange loess trend line is fitted for all the data. All data is standardised and variables are transformed where it was appropriate for analysis.}

Path coefficients where the interval (standard error) does not overlap zero are considered to be significant effects.}
